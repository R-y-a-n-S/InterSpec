/** A simple minimal dialog meant to ask the user a question modal question where user should respond before continuing.
   Kinda similar to a iOS dialog asking a question.
 
 Shown centered in the middle of the screen.
 
 TODO:
 - If you create a SimpleDialog by clicking on a button that is in a AuxWindow, the SimpleDialog will be in back of the AuxWindow.  Need
    to implement raising the SimpleDialog to be on top; in Wt 4.4.0 at least there is a bringToFront() call, but not in 3.3.4.  A work around
    for this is to post creating the SimpleDialog to WServer, and then SimpleDialog will be created on top..
 - Maybe add a way of cancelling dialog if user clicks outside of the dialog
 - Add option to not show grey cover over the rest of the window
 - Test out more

/** This header/src file holds the non-gui aware code for calculating minimum detectable activity (MDA), and detection confidence
 intervals.
 
 Notes on naming and methodology:
 - All calculations labeled as "currie" actually follow ISO 11929 methodologies for the simple gross-counts style calculation.
  E.g., A peak region is defined, and then a given number of channels are used on either side of the peak region to estimate the
  number of continuum counts inside the peak region, and variance, and then this is used to set limit from the total number or counts
  in the peak region.
  - Only single peak calculations, with no interferences are implemented.
 - All calculations labeled as "decon" use a more sophisticated  "de-convoluted" method that takes into account the shape of the peak
  and better takes into account all information provided, as well as using multiple peaks of an isotope to derive limits.  This methodology
  seems to follow the intent of Annex B of ISO 11929-3:2019, but instead these calculations form a large chi2/likelihood calculation to
  co-compute everything and hopefully do a better job.
 - Note that "Currie" is the detection-limit name, while "Curie" is the activity unit.
  
 Note: As of 20210724, these calculations have only had cursory checks performed, and have not been verified and validated to a level
  appropriate to use them for anything of importance.

 General TODO items:
 - The Currie-style limit assumes 100% of the peaks counts are within the ROI - perhaps allow a correction for this?
 - The deconvolution-style limit should allow uncertainty on the FWHM and energy calibration, to better get limits
 - More test cases need implementing

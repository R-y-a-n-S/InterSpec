/**  Widget that renders the decay chain of a given nuclide.
 
 Uses d3.js to render in SVG.  The C++ code takes care of producing the JSON
 that gets sent to the client side to be rendered.
 
 @TODO Should send the raw nuclide information to client-side to generate
       the about text when a nuclide is clicked on, instead of doing it
       in the C++ function #DecayChainChart::getTextInfoForNuclide
 @TODO Should do all JSON organization in the C++ code, rather than reformatting
       the isomeric decays client side.
 @TODO Add branching ratio and decay type next to decay lines
 @TODO The instruction text, or nuclide info text can overlap with some of the
       nuclides, for some decay schemes - should fix.
 @TODO Make static HTML/JS example versions of this widget to include in non-Wt
       based webpages.
 @TODO For the "Show decays through ..." button should decide if the text should
       be underlined, or a box-border drawn around text.
 @TODO Add a SVG and/or PNG image download option

/** Historical note: before hekili SVN revision 14173 this header/source file
    implemented a independant implementation (or at least a decent way towards
    one) of the Cuba-3.0 Cuhre integration to allow distributing the executable
    and not violate Cubas license - however, now that InterSpec is LGPL I
    (wcjohns) believe it is fair game to just (statically-)link in Cuba.  If
    this isnt the case you can recover my implementation from SVN history.

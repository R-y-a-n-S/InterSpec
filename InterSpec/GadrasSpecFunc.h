   * \param sourceIntensity Number of gammas emmited from the source (so 
   *        pre-shielding) you want continuum to coorispond to.
   * \param atomicNumber Atomic number of shielding. H=1, Al=16, etc.
   * \param arealDensity Areal density of shielding, in g/cm2.  
   * \param fractionHydrogen Fractional areal density of hydrogen in shield
   * \param xstool attenuation tool
   * \param binning The binning structure you would like #answer placed in.

   * May throw exception if #binning is not monotonically increasing in energy.

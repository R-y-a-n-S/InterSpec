  /*
   This class holds the data the SearchMode3DChart will plot; we will set this
   data using the spectrum the user is displaying.
   
   We have a slight problem in that we should use a scatter plot to represent
   our data, rather than a category plot, because a category plot makes each
   row/column the same size, however the time (row) or energy (column) range of
   may vary for our data.  We will therfore use a surface scatter plot to
   represent the data.  However, we want the chart to look like a bar chart,
   with flat bar tops, so we cant just tell Wt the counts for each time and
   energy value, because this would be the point in the center of the bin, which
   the mesh would then connect each of theses center values, and therefore be
   hard for analysts to intrepret how many counts are in that bin.
   We will therefore define counts at both the lower energy, and upper energy
   of each channel, as well as the lower time and upper time of each sample,
   meaning we will actually plot 4 points for each bin.  This is maybe a bit
   confusing, so we can talk about this.
   
   Possible TODO Items:
     -Make this model return counts per second, instead of counts.  This is 
      so count rates of time bins of differening intervals can be directly 
      compared.
     -Make it so if greater than a certain number of data points are defined (by
      having rowCount()*columnCount() be large), then only a single value per
      bin gets returned, instead of the 4 now.
     -Add coloring of the bins to the model.
     -Add mechanism to detect if an update actually needs to be performed when
      update(...) is called (e.g. if the foreground SpecMeas has actually 
      changed).
     -Improve how time samples are combined, so that if there is one large 
      background time sample, then dont combine that one with the other time 
      samples.  Or maybe dont include the background samples at all, but this 
      will require some further thought.

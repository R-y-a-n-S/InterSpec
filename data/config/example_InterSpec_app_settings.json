  "Usage": "Rename this file to 'InterSpec_app_settings.json' and placed either in the 'data' folder of the InterSpec distribution, or in the user data store (see 'Help' -> 'About InterSpec...' -> 'Data', for example on Windows: 'C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\InterSpec'.  All settings in this file are optional, so you can remove any settings you dont want to change/specify, and the default values will be used for that setting.", 
  "Purpose": "This file allows you to change settings for how InterSpec is launched; only intended for debugging or advanced usage.  You must close all InterSpec windows before settings will take effect.", 

  "ProxySetting": "",
  "ProxySetting_Documentation": "Only applicable to Windows and Linux builds. Valid values are: empty (default), 'direct', 'auto_detect', 'system'; any other string will be interpreted as the 'proxyRules' setting documented at https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/session#sessetproxyconfig (an value might be 'http=proxy.somecompany.com:80,direct://'). This setting is only applicable if you use the map tool (the only part of InterSpec to use the internet); if map tiles wont load, and you are behind a proxy, you may need to set this setting; usually a value of 'system' will work.  If you set this setting, and you are not behind a proxy, InterSpec startup time may hang for ~30 seconds, usually with a white screen, while a proxy request times out.",
  
  "HttpPortToServeOn": 0,
  "HttpPortToServeOn_Documentation": "The HTTP port to serve the application on; if zero (recommended!), will choose random high-numbered port on startup.  Otherwise you can choose a port larger than 1024 (e.x., 8080) since ports below this may require admin privileges (never run InterSpec as admin!).  If you specify a non-zero value, then only one session of InterSpec can run on your computer at a time (although that one session may have multiple windows open).",

  "RestorePreviousSession": true,
  "RestorePreviousSession_Documentation": "When true (default), InterSpec may attempt to restore your previous session in InterSpec.",

  "AllowTokenFreeSessions": false,
  "AllowTokenFreeSessions_Documentation": "Normally external sessions (i.e. 'View' -> 'Use in external browser') get assigned a one-time-use token that is required to load InterSpec into the browser.  Without a valid token, you cant load a session in the browser.  If you allow external sessions without tokens, then the token wont be needed - and any application that can access your localhost network (i.e., your computers internal network that is only accessible on your computer) can create a session and potentially access your data.  It is not recommended to to enable this setting.",

  "OpenDevTools": false,
  "OpenDevTools_Documentation": "Enables right-clicking on an element to open the WebView Dev Tools to allow debugging JavaScript errors you may run into (please report to InterSpec@sandia.gov if you find any).  On macOS you will still need to select 'Edit' -> 'Enable Web Inspector'.",

  "ArcGisKey": "",
  "ArcGisKey_Documentation": "If specified (i.e., non-empty string), this key will be used to use to access the https://arcgis.com server to get map tiles from, when you invoke invoke the map tool.",

  "MaxUndoSteps": 250,
  "MaxUndoSteps_Documentation": "The maximum number of undo/redo steps to track in memory.  A negative value disables undo/redo, and a value of zero indicates no limit.  Undo/redo is not enabled for the mobile interface (phone, or tablet with the mobile menu)."

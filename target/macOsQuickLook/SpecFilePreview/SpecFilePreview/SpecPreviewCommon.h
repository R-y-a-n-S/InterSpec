 Instructions for compiling:
   cd InterSpec
   mkdir build_quick_look
   cd build_quick_look
   cmake -DBUILD_AS_QUICK_LOOK_LIBRARY=ON ..
   make -j8
   cd ../target/macOsQuickLook/SpecFilePreview
   open SpecFilePreview.xcodeproj
   and then build
 
 TODO:
   -Create different UTTypeIdentifier types for each spectrum file format
     -Make “Conforms to UITs” indicate XML or text or whatever, as apropriate,
      so the Finder "Open With" menu will present other reasonable programs for opening
   -The Thumbnail preview sizing could be improved, as could the padding and
    text sizes individually for both preview and thumbnail
   -Should consider getting rid of y-axis numbers/title for true icon renders.
    -Need to verify, or figure out how to tell if a true icon render
   -Files with multiple spectra, but arent passthrough, currenly display as a
    single spectrum; it would be nice to allow changing spectra in the preview,
    like a PDF or Word document.  Implementing this would require generating
    the preview as a PDF... this would take some decent work.
     -See https://www.cocoanetics.com/2010/06/rendering-pdf-is-easier-than-you-thought/
      for a potential method of rendering SVG (as a webpage) to PDF.
     -Also see WPdfImage to render to PDF, and then push to apples stuff.
      Looks like WPdfImage can render to a specified page in a document.

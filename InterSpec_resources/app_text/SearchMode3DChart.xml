    The maximum number of time divisions to plot; if your data has more time-samples than
    this in the displayed range, time-samples will be combined together, until it is less than this value.
    <br />
    <br />
    For example, if this value is 60, but your measurement has 208 samples, then each 4
    samples will be summed together for a single bin for the time axis,
    with a total of 52 bins on the time axis.

    If the product of the number of time channels, times the number of energy channels
    is too large, performance issues may be encountered.

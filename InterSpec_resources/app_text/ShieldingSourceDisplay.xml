  <message id="ssd-tt-distance">
    Distance from center of source to face of detector. Number must be
    followed by units; valid units are: meters, m, cm, mm, km, feet,
    ft, ', in, inches, or ".  You may also add multiple distances,
    such as '3ft 4in', or '3.6E-2 m 12 cm' which are equivalent to
    40inches and 15.6cm respectively.

    Shieldings are treated as shells with the innermost

    the subsequent shieldings layered around that one.  Any sources
    not attributed as components of shieldings are treated as point
    sources in the center.

  <message id="ssd-tt-geometry">Geometry to use for modeling "trace" sources, or self-attenuating sources.
    <br />
    <br />
    By default, all sources are point sources at the specified distance from the detector, for all geometries.
    <br />
    However, if you make a nuclide a "trace" source (by clicking on a shielding's "<em>Add Trace Source</em>" button in lower right-hand corner of the shielding), or a self-attenuating source (by selecting the
    <em>Source for:</em>" checkbox when a shielding has the same element as a nuclide you are
    fitting), then the source isotope will be modeled as distributed throughout the shielding,
    and ray-tracing will be used to account for different attenuations at each location within
    the shielding.
    <br />
    <br />
    To keep things simple, choose "Point/Spherical" geometry unless you will perform a fit to a
    "trace" or self-attenuating source.

<p>
To change the energy range being viewed, use a single finger, and move it horizontally either left 
(to view higher energies) or right (to view lower energies).
<div style="padding-top: 10px" align="center">

Note that if the spectrums full energy range is already visible, or you have reached the lower/upper energies, 
the spectrum will not move further in that direction.
